## There are four parts to this system.
1. [UI](./ui/main-ui-document.md) - document the data generator templates build/designed are sent to the Engine
    * wireframes are kept in ui directory
2. [API](./api/Main-API-documentation.md) - documents how the UI communicats with the UI and Db
    * Any model of the API is kept in the model directory in the StarUML file.
3. [Engine](./engine/Main-Engine-documentation.md) - how the data is created
    * Any model of the Engine statemachine, etc are kept in the model directory inthe StarUML file
4. [Database](./database/Main-Database-documentation.md) - how templates are stored for work from the engine, and how data is stored before bundled and sent back to ui
