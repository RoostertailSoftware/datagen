## What is here
Many discussions and documents are going to be here in the Engine areas.  Basically, the stuff that the engine uses will be put here.  

Why?  Well, They could go in many places.  The UI uses the names of the RULES, the Server keeps the rules (or the db, not sure if I can keep code in the db but that would be cool)
and the engine uses them. So where to keep them?  I chose Engine.
