# Main Model document

## The model
The model is created using various Diagrams of UML and SysML.  The `.mdj` file extension is the product of [StarUML](https://staruml.io).

At different times there may be a `.pdf` file in the model directory. This is for quick view. Understand that these may be out of sync with the actual Model and should be looked at via the model and not the pdf for correctness.

There is currently a [ design document ](./design.md) which will go over the basic design of the system and how it all **should** work.
