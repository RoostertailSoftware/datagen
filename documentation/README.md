## There are four parts to this system.
1. [UI](./ui/Main-UI-documentation.md) - how document templates build/designed are sent to the Engine
2. [API](./api/Main-API-documentation.md) - how the UI communicats with the UI and Db
3. [Engine](./engine/Main-Engine-documentation.md) - how the data is created
4. [Database](./database/Main-Database-documentation.md) - how templates are stored for work from the engine, and how data is stored before bundled and sent back to ui
