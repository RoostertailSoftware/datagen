# Main UI Document

## The wireframes
Wireframes are created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) desktop. The file type for this `view model` is `*.bmpr`. There may be also be a few `.pdf` files in the ui directory. Understand, the wireframes on the acutal balsamiq bmpr file is the cannon and you should look at this for correctness.  Furthermore, any changes to the ui should be reflected in the wireframe.
